    "## Welcome to the project, here's the roadmap\n",
    "\n",
    "As you might know, *climate change is a thing*. Climate change will not only affect our oceans, cities and forests, but also our simulations. Just recently, the EU released their roadmap to keep atomic simulations correct through this hard times. These are the four stages that need to be achieved:\n",

    "#### DEGRADATION OF THE KINETIC ENERGY\n",
    "    \n",
    "*Climate change will take its toll on the movement of electrons. This will result in a constant increase of the energy of any system, according to the laws of quantum mechanics. The offset is expected to follow Bosoni-Febrer's equation:* $offset(year) = year - 2020$.\n",

This will of course translate in more uncertainty in the final position of electrons when atoms interact. Therefore, the optimal mixing coefficients during SCF cycles will suffer great oscillations.
